Bits (not Bytes) are the hard currency of the 77-Bit game. With it you can purchase things in the premium store like lootboxes, character skins, chromium, dungeon tickets, Darknet keys, skill resets and even your battlepass.

Now everyone has a different budget when it comes to games, from those who will buy the skill reset token at 1900 Bits to use as a teleport scroll to Byte City (you know who you are) to those who will only spend the daily free 20 Bits. This guide aims to help you make the most out of the Bits you are ready to spend!

Each section is split into low and high cost suggestions to help you fit in your budget. The first section is specific to new players, and the rest assume you are level 30.

# Level 1 Purchases

If you just arrived in the world of 77-Bit, these are for you to help you get started.

## Low Cost

### Starter Pack (500 Bits)

![starter_pack.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/starter_pack.png)

The starter pack gets you a full set of gear you will be keeping until level 30. Along that it will give you a basic weapon to get you started. Make sure you level it up to level 10 asap (careful with the reforge though, you might break it).

<aside>

If the weapon you get from the Starter Pack has 22 weapon damage, CONGRATS! 
Itâ€™s one of the best scaling weapons in the game.

## High Cost

### Battlepass (4200 Bits)

![battle_pass.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/battle_pass.png)

This is no surprise, if you care about the game the battlepass will give you (when fully completed) around 500,000 Bytes, an extra 3.4x boost, a 3x better conversion of pixels on top of that, and many resources and lootboxes. **AN ABSOLUTE MUST.**

### Beta Weapon Cartridge (900 Bits)

![beta_lootbox.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/beta_lootbox.png)

The lootbox is in the highcost section because itâ€™s not necessary, and to get something worth out of it you would need to be lucky. Also, **once you are level 30 you have a much better version of this lootbox available.** If you can afford it early though, it can give you the second best weapon in the game, so worth the gamble! Only keep the weapons that have 220 weapon damage from this lootbox.

# S-Tier Purchases

These are the items in the shop you absolutely must buy once you reach level 30.

## Low Cost

### Darknet Survivor Bundle (1000 Bits)

![survivor_bundle.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/survivor_bundle.png)

You need to be **level 30** to buy this one from **SENSEI.EXE in the Darknet.** This is the best, cheap item you can purchase with your Bits. It will give you a full set of Darknet tier I gear, which will massively help you survive grinding the Darknet higher layers.

### Admin_Admin Key (800 Bits)

![admin_admin.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/admin_admin.png)

This is the 24h access key for all Darknet layers. This is useless if you donâ€™t have access to the darknet yet! It lets you access any of the 6 Darknet Layers as much as you want. This means you save up on the cost of keys and have much less stress about dying or getting disconnected during a run. **If youâ€™re able to consistently run Darknet L2+, this is a must.**

## High Cost

### Voidbreaker Bundle (1500 Bits)

![voidbreaker.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/voidbreaker.png)

You need to be **level 30** to buy this one from **SENSEI.EXE in the Darknet.** It is a MUCH BETTER version of the Beta Lootbox. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Guaranteed VANDAL rarity weapon** (much better odds for double dmg)
- **Guaranteed 400 lesser chromium + 200 common chromium + 100 rare chromium**
- 3 Reforge Schematics for that weapon

This is HUGE to help you get started crafting a good weapon. Probably the best bang for your Bits in the entire game, even if it has a slightly higher price. Again, only the weapons with 220 weapon damage are worth keeping from this box... but you always get chromium which is amazing.

# A-Tier Purchases

## Low Cost

### Dungeon Explorer Pack (500 Bits)

![dungeon_explorer.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/dungeon_explorer.png)

This one is if you need to run the dungeons to get a decent weapon. This will be more efficient than farming the darknet, and the ticket will allow you unlimited entry for 24h. Keep killing the boss and collecting the weapon lootbox until you have enough 82 weapon damage bases to upgrade.

## High Cost

### Skill Reset (1900 Bits)

![skill_reset.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/skill_reset.png)

This one is very situational, and could even be S-Tier for those of you who made the terribly misguided decisions to use Laser Beam instead of Photon Torpedo. If your build is not optimal, it can be worth spending the Bits to respec to something that will let you farm a lot more and ultimately make your experience more enjoyable.

## Outfit Cartridge (1500 Bits)

![outfit_cartridge.png](/content/best-premium-purchases/outfit_cartridge.png)

This one gets an honorary mention because while it doesnâ€™t help your gameplay directly, the skins in 77-Bit all look awesome as hell. And we all know the most important part of any MMO is to look good!

# Other Purchases

Everything else is not really worth buying. Especially the reforge schematics and the chromium, unless you are a whale and want to save time.
