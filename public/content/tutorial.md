# Completing the In-Game Tutorial

When you first log into the game, you will spawn inside a train. This train is taking you to the OPSEC Headquarters to start your training, so buckle up.

> 💡
> 
> **TAKE THE TIME TO READ THE DIALOGUES. THEY EXPLAIN HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.**


## Movement

To move your character, use the WASD keys on your keyboard.

## Leaving the train

Simply walk down the train car all the way to the 3 arrows indicating the exit. The train will arrive at OPSEC HQ and let you out. Walk up the platform and take to the right.

## First quest

Further ahead you will see an NPC named Shadow Broker with a ❕ mark. This means he has a quest for you. So walk up to him and left click to interact.

**READ THE DIALOGUES.** I can't repeat this enough. They contain valuable information you don't want to miss.

Yellow dialogue options make the quest progress, while white dialogue options give you more info and context. Read the white options first if you wish to, then click on the yellow option to continue.

> 💡
> 
> You can always open your quest log by pressing `?`

## Equipping gear

Your first quest is to go pick up gear and equip yourself. Walk down to the right of the map, you'll find a levitating box. Walk over it and you'll receive a weapon and a cyberskin (armor). 

Open your inventory by pressing `i` and then either double-click or right-click + click "equip" on each to equip them.

Once you did that, go back to the Shadow Broker for your next steps. He will then instruct you to go test out this new gear.

## Combat

Head up the map to where a machine will spawn a dummy sentry. Kill it using your basic attack (left mouse button) or power attack (right mouse button).

After that head back to the Shadow Broker for the next step.

## Hacker Special Skill

You are currently playing the Hacker class, whose special skill can hack doors. Walk up to the door right next to the Shadow Broker and press `left shift` to hack it. The door will open.

Left click on the door to head inside. This will load the next zone for the tutorial.

## OPSEC HQ

Once inside the headquarters, walk up. You will need to open a larger door, simply by clicking on it. Then go talk to Vigilix for your next steps. Once you have your quest, head to the right through another large door.

Keep walking to the next door, which is temporarily locked (displayed by the ⏳ sign) while a voice talks. Once the voice is done talking, you can open the door and fight your first real enemies.

> 💡
> 
> Don't forget to loot the pixels that drop from the monsters you kill. Simply walk over them to pick them up.

## Sentinel Special Skill

Once you killed and looted the enemies, keep going. You'll find Vigilix again waiting for you, so talk to him. Once you get the next step, go through the door behind him. **Do not go to the group of mobs on the right**. Kill the mob behind the door (careful he has a spin attack when you are too close).

> 💡
> 
> Always look to your minimap for directions. Quest objectives are clearly displayed on it.

Once you've killed the mob you can go over the floating chest, which will change your class from hacker to sentinel (you need to do this, don't worry you'll choose a class after the tutorial).

Now that you are a sentinel, go back down to the right and go kill all the mobs. After that you'll see a big pink energy barrier. **You need to activate the sentinel skill** with `left shift` to get a shield which allows you to pass through the barrier without dying.

## Technomancer Special Skill

Once through, kill the mob and head towards the floating box right behind it in the hallway.

![image_cyberkey (1).png](/content/tutorial/54e9d27b-7212-4dbf-8ab8-042b5a0454df.png)

When above the technomancer case, open your inventory by pressing `i`. Then go to the consumables tab (last one, looks like a potion) and right click the **CYBERKEY** item. Then click "use".

This will once again change your class to Technomancer, so you can proceed with the quest. Keep going down and kill all the mobs. Once that's done, head to the energy prison where the prisoner is being held.

You need to step right next to him (the barrier can't kill you), and use the Technomancer special skill to heal him by pressing `left shift`.

Talk with the prisoner to proceed with the quest. Then turn around and go by the big green desk and interact with it.

Once you're done with that, the door next to you will open. Go back to Vigilix (where he was at the beginning, just on the left) to finish the quest. Then leave the OPSEC HQ from where you first came in to go back to the Shadow Broker.

Congrats, you finished the 77-Bit tutorial. Go back to the train you came out of at the very beginning so it can take you to Byte City.
