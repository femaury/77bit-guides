In the world of 77-Bit, there are special Quests which you can do once every day. The reset happens at 00:00 UTC. If you accepted some of these quests and don’t complete them before midnight UTC, they will automatically fail. The NPCs will then have new quests for you.

Dailies are displayed in bright blue in your quest log with a special “Repeatable” icon.

> 💡
>
> For the NPCs which have multiple possible Dailies, abandoning the one you get will not give you a chance at getting a different one. You’ll only be able to retry the same one until the next day.

# Must Do Dailies

There is actually only one Daily Quest which you should absolutely do every time you can. You need to be level 20 in order to have this quest.

## Hunting Grounds

### Ryker: Small Treat

It’s given by Ryker in the Hunting Grounds map (in the camp on the far left of the map). He has 3 Daily Quests and gives you one of the 3 each day randomly, so you might not always see Small Treat.

![small_treat.png](/content/dailies/small_treat.png)

This quest requires you to simply walk to the fishing cabin and interact with the cat laying there. The cat is rich af and will reward you with a **Supply Pack III.**

Here is what’s inside the Supply Pack III:

- Dungeon Tickets (0 to 3)
- Mega Chromium (0 to 30)
- Giga Chromium (0 to 15)

> 💡
>
> With the current state of the game, this is a great way to slowly build up some mega and giga chromium. This might not be as important to do once we can reliably farm the Darknet higher levels after the Darknet economy patch.

# Important Dailies (Dungeon Tickets)

The important dailies are all the ones which can earn you **Dungeon Tickets**. Since this is the only reliable way to get dungeon tickets for free (without counting the dungeons themselves), it might be worth for you to complete them.

Any quest which gives you a **Resource Pack** (Supply Pack, Bites Pack, Amplifiers Pack, Reforge Pack, Voidware Pack, etc…) is important since each of these Resource Packs **can contain between 0 and 3 Dungeon Tickets.**

# Other Dailies

The rest of the dailies in the game only reward you with pixels and XP like the ones in Smugglers Run and Byte City... not enough to be worth your time.
Better off selling feet pics to castor.

# End Note

As a lot of these quests and rewards are based on RNG, this guide might have missing or innacurate information. If you find that this is the case, please do ping me on the 77-Bit discord server `@wareep`.

See you in the simulation!
