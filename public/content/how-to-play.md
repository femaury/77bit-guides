77-Bit is a browser based MMORPG. This means no download is required to play the game, you simply need a device which has access to internet and a mouse and keyboard.

The game can also be accessed through BitHub from the play button top left.

## Minimum Required Specs

The game runs on browser and has pretty low required computer specs. It also has an option in the settings to turn on potato mode and disable animations (this is prompted to you on launch if the game detects that it‚Äôs struggling).

Other than that make sure to have a solid internet connection (prefer cable over wifi of course) and a decent amount of RAM.

## Log in

If you weren‚Äôt already connected to BitHub, you‚Äôll need to login. You can use any of the methods you have **already** linked to your BitHub account. Using a new method **will create a new account.**

## Queue

Once logged in, if there are too many players currently trying to get in, you will be placed in a queue system. **Do not close or refresh the page** once you are in the queue or you will be put back at the end of the queue!

Simply wait until you reach position 1, and then you will be taken to the lobby automatically.

## Lobby

Once in the lobby, you will be presented with a choice of **skins.** These are not different characters, simply different skins for your only character. 

- You can select a display name for your character right next to its head.
- You can freely change skins every time you log in without affecting your character progress.

### Character Skins

These are different from the cosmetic skins you can purchase in the premium store. They are the base representation of your character.

Each 77-Bit NFT has its own unique skin which you can equip if you own the NFT in a wallet connected to your account.

If you don‚Äôt own a 77-Bit NFT, you will have the default Anon skin.

For 77-Bit‚Äôs Beta, since the new NFT art is not yet revealed, only 6 base NFT skins are available, depending on the Type trait of the NFT(s) you own.

1 Guy / 1 Girl / 1 Ape / 1 Punk / 2 Cyborgs

### Other tabs

You can also access the premium shop and the battlepass pages from the lobby.

## Play

Once you have selected a skin and a name‚Ä¶ click play.

This will start loading the game while a cutscene plays. Once the game is ready, a SKIP button will appear in the bottom left of your screen.

Press `F11` (or `cmd + ctrl + F` on mac) to go fullscreen and lock in.
