# Choosing a Class

Congrats, you completed the tutorial. After having quickly tried each of the three classes and put to use their respective special abilities, here comes your first decision in 77-Bit.

Which class will you pick?

> ⚠️
> 
> You cannot change classes later in the game. This decision is final.


> 💡
> 
> Note that **each class can play the game solo** and deal enough damage to progress through the whole experience. If you play in a group, make sure to synergise your class and skill decisions with your teammates!
>
> **If you want the easiest progression, pick the Technomancer class and make sure to take Photon Torpedo as your first skill.**

> 💡
> 
> Also note that **each class can use every weapon**, melee or ranged, without penalty. Skills are tied to your character and not your weapon.
